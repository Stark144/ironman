		 In the films, Stark is an industrialist, genius inventor, hero and former playboy who is CEO of Stark Industries.
		<br/>
		At the beginning of the series, he is a chief weapons manufacturer for the U.S. military, until he has a change of heart and redirects his technical knowledge into the creation of mechanized suits of armor which he uses to defend against those that would threaten peace around the world.
